# Trendsetter

Trendsetter is Node.js package for generating beautiful interactive styleguides with ease. 

Front-end frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) are awesome. The most awesome feature of these frameworks is not their plethora of shiny components but instead their thorough documentation. Having extensive front-end documentation helps prevent developers from writing redundant code, makes it easier to on-board new developers to a project, and ensures better communication between front-end and back-end devs.

As awesome as front-end frameworks are, sometimes you just want to roll your own and that's where Trendsetter comes in. Trendsetter will parse your stylesheets for comments and automatically create beautiful documentation.
